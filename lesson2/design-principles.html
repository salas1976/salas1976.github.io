            <h2>Repetition</h2>

            <p>This picture from the Cookiessf website is a great example of how the rule of repetition can be used, not only on photographs but also as a way to enhance the website’s experience. This website si definitely about branding so the "C” at the top of the page being re-enforced by the “C” brand on the apparel in the photograph and other items listed on the website. This adds consistency and unity to the design making easier for the viewer to understand the purpose of why they landed on the website. All hero images contain a piece of the brand.

        <div class="alignment">
            <h2>Alignment</h2>

            <a href="https://donuts.domains/">Donuts Inc</a>
            <img src="images2/donuts.domains.jpg" alt="donuts">
            <p>Donuts Inc’s website make use of good alignment with some inconsistencies. On desktop view, the designer choose to use left alignment consistently through out the page. But in mobile view the designer chooses to use a combination of left and center alignment. It hard to tell if this is on purpose or if it’s a mistake. In my opinion the design should choose either one. Probably for mobile view, the centered paragraph works best.

                In mobile vire, the rounded-corners squares are placed and centered very well for the layout, making easy on the reader. The use of good margins also help with readability. The logo could use better placement in this view; it’s not either centered not left aligned. I would align it left for this view.

            <img src="images2/naranga.jpg" alt="naranga">
            <p>Naranga website has a lot of proximity for example header you can see the logo
                and the paragraph they are close, next in the center we have another paragraph
                close to more details botton, in footer we have chat botton, and unblock notifications
                botton.
