            <p>This picture from the Cookiessf website is a great example of how
                 the Rule of repetition can be uesd not only a
                photograph but also enhancing the website. note that is 
                the top page , which has a C, and the other  C
                 focus, in the man jacket.

            <p>The Lumineers are known for their throw-back and simple style of
                music. This same simplicity is also conveyed in their website.
                This example shows that often less is more and the proper use of
                white space can do more for your website than overcrowding it.
                A clean design is more attractive to the eye and less confusing 
                to the brain.

            <p>Mekanism is an advertising agency known for their innovation 
                and creativity, which can be seen from their website. This 
                image is a wonderful example of how powerful the principle 
                of contrast can draw attention to web design. Not only do 
                the colors contrast but there is a nice distinction between 
                the texture of the background and foreground. This is also 
                an ideal example of a photograph using the rule of thirds.
