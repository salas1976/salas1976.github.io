            <p>This picture from the Sweet Street website is a great example of how
                 dynamic the Rule of Thirds can be in not only elevating a
                photograph but also enhancing the website. Please note that 
                the front cake, which has more contrast in its coloring, is
                in focus and placed to draw attention. As you gaze a moment 
                more, the three cakes diagonally create a line that leads 
                the eye across the photo.

            <p>The Lumineers are known for their throw-back and simple style of
                music. This same simplicity is also conveyed in their website.
                This example shows that often less is more and the proper use of
                white space can do more for your website than overcrowding it.
                A clean design is more attractive to the eye and less confusing 
                to the brain.

            <p>Mekanism is an advertising agency known for their innovation 
                and creativity, which can be seen from their website. This 
                image is a wonderful example of how powerful the principle 
                of contrast can draw attention to web design. Not only do 
                the colors contrast but there is a nice distinction between 
                the texture of the background and foreground. This is also 
                an ideal example of a photograph using the rule of thirds.
